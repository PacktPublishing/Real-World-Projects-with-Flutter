## About the Video Course
Flutter is quickly becoming a well-known framework for developing cross-platform apps for both Android and iOS devices. Apps made with Flutter are very fast because of their high rendering power. This course is for developers who have been studying Flutter but have hit some roadblocks in the next steps of their development. The course is designed to bridge any questions or issues that you may have while creating complete Android and iOS applications.

This course models real world problems and then teaches the steps and techniques for creating solutions in the form of complete Android and iOS applications. With Flutter, you will develop multiple apps for both stores with just one code base. You will be able to build app layouts, widget animation, pulling and pushing data to servers and compiling codes and release to both the Stores.

By the end of this course, you will have the skills and confidence to start creating Android & iOS apps straight away with Flutter.
